# CuisineQuest

**Problem Domain:** Recipes

This project focuses on offering users a tailored approach to cooking and meal planning. By leveraging the [edamam recipe API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api) and [edamam nutrition API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api )
, we will develope an application with two core mechanisms:

## 1. Recipe Finder

This tool allows users to:
- Find a single recipe based on specific criteria such as:
  - Ingredients on hand
  - Preferred calorie range
  - Desired cuisine type
  - dietary restrictions
- Gain insights into preparation time, difficulty level, and more.

## 2. Meal Planner

Our meal planner is designed for those who wish to organize their culinary week ahead. Features include:
- Crafting a comprehensive meal plan based on:
  - Available ingredients
  - Caloric goals
  - Specific cuisines
  - Dietary restrictions
- Providing a grocery list of items needed.
- Scheduling meals for specific times and days.
